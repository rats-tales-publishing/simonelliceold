							<li>Name: <i>Hesketh</i></li>
							<li>Age: <i>22</i></li>
							<li>Eyes: <i>Brown</i></li>
							<li>Hair: <i>Dirty Blonde</i></li> 
							<li>Height: <i>5'5"</i></li>

						</p>
						<p>
						<p class="quote">“And Hesketh, who hadn’t quite worked out that she no longer had to prove herself.”</p>
						<p class="right">- Si</p>
						<p>
						Hesketh is  from a solid working class background. She’s secure, knows who she is, is unequivocally here in the world and getting on with it without angst. She’s tough, matter of fact and in many ways a natural soldier. She has good intelligence and good emotional intelligence (more than Si in many ways). She's an extravert and in any situation she finds it easy to focus on objectives rather than other’s feelings. 
						</p><p>
						She fancies Si a lot. And she admires him without any illusions about his faults. She finds his company exciting and responds to his courage and intelligence. Because she is an open book, the others are aware of how she feels about Si. Although she is the only woman in a company of men, she has amply proved herself and there is no tension between her and the rest. C section is a company of professionals and the job comes first.
						</p><p>
						 If there is heroism in this story, you could say that it belongs most to Hesketh. Si’s motivations are selfish at best, but Hesketh is doing her duty, following Si into danger willingly out of love. When she says she wouldn’t have missed it for the world, she means it.

							<li>Name: <i>Gerald Page, Second Lieutenant </i></li>
							<li>Age: <i>26</i></li>
							<li>Eyes: <i>Blue flecked with hazel</i></li>
							<li>Hair: <i>Walnut brown, receding slightly</i></li> 
							<li>Height: <i>6'0"</i></li>
							<li>Interests: <i>Literature, supports Chelsea FC, a decent rugby player </i></li> 
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
						<p class="quote"> “You won’t do anything silly if I go?”</p>
						<p class="right">- Gerald</p>
						<p>
						Si’s equal in rank, the only other junior officer, the two share the grunt-work of overseeing everything that can’t be left to non-commissioned officers. They take command duty of the Patrol Base on a shift when Snowhall and Dan Granger (his second in command) are sleeping or otherwise busy. They lead patrols, undertake training, supervise and inspect work parties and those on stag (guard duty).
						</p><p>
						Gerald is a good, capable, loyal officer. Easy going, likeable and competent. He doesn’t have Si’s flair, or Si’s risk taking ability. He knows his worth and also appreciates Si’s qualities. He will go on from here to have a good career in the army, but not a spectacular one.

						<p class="quote"> “You’re a sick bastard. You know that?”</p>
						<p class="right">- Snowhall</p>
						<p>
						Professional soldier. Early fifties. Lower middle class. Home counties. Has reached the end of his chances of promotion. Likes to do things by the book. Is in over his head in a situation where those in command of him are requiring things of him which the situation on the ground doesn’t allow. Not an unjust or an unkind man, but not as strong as the situation requires. He finds Si’s confidence and carelessness annoying and the way the men look up to him, galling.
						</p><p>
						He struggles to make decisions solely on objectives, rather than on other’s feelings and wellbeing (unlike Si) and is trying to protect the lives of his soldiers when, from a purely military point of view, he needs to put them at risk.

						<ul>
							<li>Name: <i>Samantha Jane Wealdon</i></li>

						<p class="right">- Zara</p>
						<p>
						Guy's bloodthirsty and beautiful daughter, whose wild nature is matched with Si's calculated grace. She has her mother's looks, presumably, and her father's brains; disturbingly, a lot of his personality too. Not one to discriminate, Guy brought her up as he would a son; teaching her the art of war, not peace. 
						</p><p>
						Bright as polished steel, she picked up an education of sorts in between expulsions from the best schools. Where Guy is a cold fish, Sam has passions; immoderate, unreasonable, destructive passions. Like Si, she can handle anything, except boredom. 
						</p><p>
						Where Simon acts with considered precision, Sam finds joy in mindless violence. Exciting as he finds her, Simon begins to realise that she might be more trouble than she’s worth. When the mood takes her she will kill for pleasure and she will not tolerate any other women having any importance in the lives of the men within her orbit. When Simon is bored he may do something dangerous, when Sam is bored she will do something destructive.

						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Name: <i>Guy Wealdon</i></li>
							<li>Age: <i>58</i></li>
							<li>Eyes: <i>Black</i></li>
							<li>Hair: <i>Dark but Greying</i></li> 
							<li>Height: <i>5'11</i></li>

						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
						<p class="quote">“He finds people useful or convenient and that’s about it” </p>
						<p class="right">- Zara</p>
						<p>
						Ruthless, manipulative and utterly amoral, he is the scorpion who stung the frog. His nature undoes him. Presented with an opportunity for personal gain, or the destruction of others he will cheat, lie and kill without self restraint.
						</p><p>
						Although outwardly relaxed and apparently lazy, Guy has a driven quality. He sees others as objects for his use. He takes his reward in life from exercising his will over it and is in a subconscious war with the world of his class and peers which has rejected him. He comes from a military background, public school, Sandhurst, the Guards, but has a fatal flaw in his character which always leads him to defeat himself by doing something for a short term gain instead of a long term win.
						</p><p>
						Moving barely a step ahead of trouble from the Army to the darker peripheries of intelligence he finally fled the UK just ahead of the police with a good pile of his friends’ money. He washed up in the ancient smuggling port of Nador, Morocco where he set himself up as a small king in the teeth of those already there. He was building a reasonable trade in getting hash from the Rif mountains into Spain when he came across an opportunity to make some real money…
						</p><p>
						Never married, he has a daughter, the only person he’s ever had any respect for and perhaps, cared for: Sam.

						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Name: <i>Soumaiya Demsiri (Soumy)</i></li>
							<li>Age: <i>20</i></li>
							<li>Eyes: <i>Dark</i></li>
							<li>Hair: <i>Dark </i></li> 
							<li>Height: <i>5'3</i></li>
							<li>Interests: <i>Literature, languages, history, an excellent cook </i></li> 
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
						<p class="quote">“She has a way of looking at me from under her long lashes that is very sad. </p>
						<p class="right">- Si</p>
						<p>
						Slavery of one kind or another was written into Soumy’s destiny from generations back. As a child of a poor family and as a woman, she was never more than a commodity. Her father gave her to Guy in recompense for a consignment of hash that was lost. As the most beautiful of his women, he used her to keep house, and whatever else was asked of her, for his right-hand man. 
						</p><p>
						If Si treated her better than she expected, it was little to his credit. She served him as a slave and he accepted her service. He let her wear western clothes and didn’t beat her. Big deal. Where he is selfish and thoughtless she is kind and caring. Soumy is probably the wisest person Si will ever know. And one of the strongest. Sometimes he has the sense to see this and do what she tells him.

							<li>Name: <i>Zara</i></li>
							<li>Age: <i>Wouldn't you like to know</i></li>
							<li>Eyes: <i>Watery blue</i></li>
							<li>Hair: <i>Bleach Blonde</i></li>

						<p class="quote"> “I used to have an arse like that.” </p>
						<p class="right">- Zara</p>
						<p>
						Zara is the latest in Guy’s carousel of amusements. Narcissistic, conceited and almost over the hill, with less significance to Guy than one of his cars; the only value she puts on herself is in her appearance. She is content as long as she’s got a drink in her hand and can most often be found passed out on a sun lounger by the pool. 
						</p><p>
						She is bitterly jealous of Sam, who aside from being young and beautiful, was a feature of Guy’s life before and will remain after Zara is discarded. Sam takes joy in tormenting Zara with her impermenancy: although Zara is historically an alpha female, she is nothing compared to Sam, who wins altercations before they even begin.
