						<p>
						Guy's bloodthirsty and beautiful daughter, whose wild nature is matched with Si's calculated grace. She has her mother's looks, presumably, and her father's brains; disturbingly, a lot of his personality too. Not one to discriminate, Guy brought her up as he would a son; teaching her the art of war, not peace. 
						</p><p>
						Bright as polished steel, she picked up an education of sorts in between expulsions from the best schools. Where Guy is a cold fish, Sam has passions; immoderate, unreasonable, destructive passions. Like Si, she can handle anything, except boredom. 
						</p><p>
						Where Simon acts with considered precision, Sam finds joy in mindless violence. Exciting as he finds her, Simon begins to realise that she might be more trouble than she’s worth. When the mood takes her she will kill for pleasure and she will not tolerate any other women having any importance in the lives of the men within her orbit. When Simon is bored he may do something dangerous, when Sam is bored she will do something destructive.

						<p class="quote">“He finds people useful or convenient and that’s about it” </p>
						<p class="right">- Zara</p>
						<p>
						Ruthless, manipulative and utterly amoral, he is the scorpion who stung the frog. His nature undoes him. Presented with an opportunity for personal gain, or the destruction of others he will cheat, lie and kill without self restraint.
						</p><p>
						Although outwardly relaxed and apparently lazy, Guy has a driven quality. He sees others as objects for his use. He takes his reward in life from exercising his will over it and is in a subconscious war with the world of his class and peers which has rejected him. He comes from a military background, public school, Sandhurst, the Guards, but has a fatal flaw in his character which always leads him to defeat himself by doing something for a short term gain instead of a long term win.
						</p><p>
						Moving barely a step ahead of trouble from the Army to the darker peripheries of intelligence he finally fled the UK just ahead of the police with a good pile of his friends’ money. He washed up in the ancient smuggling port of Nador, Morocco where he set himself up as a small king in the teeth of those already there. He was building a reasonable trade in getting hash from the Rif mountains into Spain when he came across an opportunity to make some real money…
						</p><p>
						Never married, he has a daughter, the only person he’s ever had any respect for and perhaps, cared for: Sam.
