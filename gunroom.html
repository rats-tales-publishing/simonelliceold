						<p>
						Hesketh is  from a solid working class background. She’s secure, knows who she is, is unequivocally here in the world and getting on with it without angst. She’s tough, matter of fact and in many ways a natural soldier. She has good intelligence and good emotional intelligence (more than Si in many ways). She's an extravert and in any situation she finds it easy to focus on objectives rather than other’s feelings. 
						</p><p>
						She fancies Si a lot. And she admires him without any illusions about his faults. She finds his company exciting and responds to his courage and intelligence. Because she is an open book, the others are aware of how she feels about Si. Although she is the only woman in a company of men, she has amply proved herself and there is no tension between her and the rest. C section is a company of professionals and the job comes first.
						</p><p>
						 If there is heroism in this story, you could say that it belongs most to Hesketh. Si’s motivations are selfish at best, but Hesketh is doing her duty, following Si into danger willingly out of love. When she says she wouldn’t have missed it for the world, she means it.

But a serious and conscientious soldier and an excellent shot. Harmless, well-meaning, likeable, kind and loyal. Liked and trusted by the others. He looks up to Si, but wouldn’t say so out loud.

						Si’s equal in rank, the only other junior officer, the two share the grunt-work of overseeing everything that can’t be left to non-commissioned officers. They take command duty of the Patrol Base on a shift when Snowhall and Dan Granger (his second in command) are sleeping or otherwise busy. They lead patrols, undertake training, supervise and inspect work parties and those on stag (guard duty).
						</p><p>
						Gerald is a good, capable, loyal officer. Easy going, likeable and competent. He doesn’t have Si’s flair, or Si’s risk taking ability. He knows his worth and also appreciates Si’s qualities. He will go on from here to have a good career in the army, but not a spectacular one.

						Professional soldier. Early fifties. Lower middle class. Home counties. Has reached the end of his chances of promotion. Likes to do things by the book. Is in over his head in a situation where those in command of him are requiring things of him which the situation on the ground doesn’t allow. Not an unjust or an unkind man, but not as strong as the situation requires. He finds Si’s confidence and carelessness annoying and the way the men look up to him, galling.
						</p><p>
						He struggles to make decisions solely on objectives, rather than on other’s feelings and wellbeing (unlike Si) and is trying to protect the lives of his soldiers when, from a purely military point of view, he needs to put them at risk.

						The 2IC of patrol base Azun, under Major Snowhall. Dan is left with the day-to-day detail (and a good deal of the stress) of running the base. As a result, he is an insomniac and looks far older than he is. He is popular among the men as he tends to have their best interests at heart, and always advocates for them.
						</p><p>
						Granger is constantly making up for Snowhall's shortcomings. Where Snowhall acts too much from the heart, Dan is forced to be objective and carry the mental weight that Snowhall won't shoulder.

						Omar Wardak is a slippery man, never quite in the grasp of the military, but always nearby. Although he is Taliban, he has the sympathies of the local Nuristani villagers and uses their help to conduct his attacks.

						Although the Taliban has tried to fuel intertribal warfare in Nuristan, ultimately, the British forces are the outsiders, and Wardak uses this fuel dissent among the locals.

						The Nuristani village magistrates, or Jast, are responsible for organizing local festivals and dances and will serve as the official host for guests to the village. One reason that wealth is a prerequisite for leadership in Nuristan appears to be related to the fact that the Jast is frequently required to pay for local feasts and celebrations.
						</p><p>
						Although the role of the Jast is important, he would rarely exercise bold leadership. Consensus is very important among the Nuristanis, both within the ruling Urir and within the larger tribe. This is at least partially due to the fact that the Urir never had any independent governmental power to enforce its decisions.

						Throughout Dead Ground, you can follow the story of Hassan through the illustrations. His is a story of loss of innocence and radicalisation.

						The Nuristanis are a small and ancient collection of approximately 15 tribes in northeast Afghanistan in the provinces of Lagman and Konar along the Afghan-Pakistan border. The Nuristanis were also known for centuries among other Muslim Afghans by the pejorative.
						</p><p>
						For centuries the Nuristanis lived in a quasi-independent state of Nuristan (also called Kafirstan). Nuristan is approximately 5,000 square miles in area. Throughout the 19th century the Nuristani tribes fell between the Afghan and British Indian empires, but frequently fell under term “Kafirs” (infidels), due to their historical refusal to convert to Islam. 
						</p><p>
						Although the Nuristani tribes share similar customs and traditions, they speak five different languages. While there is some overlap between some of the Nuristani languages, many of the Nuristani tribes cannot communicate with one another. Some Nuristanis claim that they are descendants of the Greek occupying forces of Alexander the Great, who conquered the region in 327 B.C.
						</p><p>

 						</p><p>	
 						 Towards the end of the 19th century the Afghans and British established the “Durrand Line” between Afghan controlled territories and British India. The “Durrand Line” ceded most of Nuristan into the Afghan sphere of influence, with the exception of some of the Kalash tribes. Between 1893-96, King Abdul Rahman of Afghanistan formally incorporated Nuristan (Kafirstan) into Afghanistan, forcibly converting the Nuristanis to Islam and officially naming the region Nuristan, which means “Land of Light.”

						Nuristani forms a linguistic group as a well as an ethnic group. Within the Indo-European linguistic family, the Nuristani language group forms a third sub-group of the Indo-Iranian group. This Nuristani language group is now believed not to be a part of a larger “Dardic” group of Indo-Iranian languages, including Khowar and Dardi (Kashmiri).
						</p><p>	
						Although the Nuristani are a small group of people and form a single language group, they are linguistically very diverse within this group. This linguistic diversity is sustained by the inaccessible nature of many of the geographical enclaves in which many of these subtribes live. There are five languages spoken among the approximately fifteen Nuristani subtribes: Vasi, Kamkata viri, aSkuNu viri, Kalasa, and Tregami. Vasi and Kamkata viri form a Northern Nuristani language cluster, which has been more influenced by subsequent Iranian languages that have spread through the Hindu Kush. ASkuNu viri, Kalasa, and Tregami form a Southern Nuristani language cluster, which retains a purer connection to the original Indo-Iranian subgroup. Among these languages, there are many dialects, some of which vary village to village. Some of these dialects overlap between the languages.
						</p><p>	
						Vasi is spoken in Upper, Middle, and Lower dialects by the Vasi people of the Parun valley.
						</p><p>		
						Kamakata viri is spoken by the Kata, Kom, Mumo, kSto, bini, Jamco, and Jasi peoples. The Kata speak two dialects of Kamakata viri, known as Western and Eastern Katavari. Western Katavari is spoken in Ramgal, which is the upper Alingar river basin, in the Ktivi valley, off the upper Pech river, and in the PeRuk valley, off the upper LanDai Sin. Eastern Katavari is spoken in the upper LanDai Sin, and along the Pakistani border. The Kom, kSto, Jasi, Binio, and Jamco speak another dialect, Kamviri or kStaviri.
						</p><p>	
						The Mumo speak a transitional dialect, Mumviri, which is between Kamviri and Eastern Katavari.
						</p><p>	
						AskuNu viri is spoken by the aSku people. Among the aSku, there are different dialects among the peoples of the Bazaigal, Kolata, and Titin valleys off the middle Alingar, and among the Sama and gRamsaNa peoples of the middle Pech river valley.
						</p><p>	
						The Kalasa people speak Kalasa, as well as the three other ethnic groups, the Vata, the kSto and the kStorm. A major dialect separates the Varjan Kalasa of the upper Vaigal river valley from the Cima-Nisei Kalasa of the lower Vaigal valley. Among the Varjan, there are minor dialects within each village.
						</p><p>	
						Kalasha is also spoken by Nuristanis living in the valleys of Bumboret, Birir, and Rumbur in the Pakistani district of Chitral in the Northwest Frontier Province.
						</p><p>	
						Tregami is spoken by the Tregami people in three villages of the Tregam valley of the lower Pech river.

						The houses in the highest northern regions are built of stone or brick. The houses in the steep forested regions are mainly of wood, often in several stories, stepwise above each other. The lower level of a house usually contains a stable and storage area. The upper floor is generally a large single room in which the family cooks, sleeps, and receives guests. One house’s roof serves as a patio to the house above. These patios are used for drying fruit. This configuration is chosen in order to save what little arable land there is for cultivation purposes. The patios are connected to each other with ladders, which facilitate movement around the village.
						</p><p>
						 All villages have a common gromma, or dancing floor. Dancing is an integral part of Nuristani culture and pre-Islamic religious life. At least up until the end of the 19th century, every village also had a stone altar near the gromma.
						 </p><p>
						Nuristani houses often have wooden verandas along the front, wooden facades, and a hearth in the middle of the main room. The hearth is surrounded by four wooden pillars, sometimes carved to resemble deities, and there is a smoke hole in the roof over the hearth. 
						</p><p>
						Having carved wooden pillars and carved wood facades along the exterior verandas are symbols of social importance within the Nuristani tribes. Lower classes of workers are not permitted to carve wood within their houses. In addition to Kalash deities, Nuristani wood carvings include goats and criss-cross basket patterns.
						</p><p>
						These wooden houses are built of posts and beams, hewn by hand. The spaces between the timbers are filled with stones and clay.

						<p>
						Guy's bloodthirsty and beautiful daughter, whose wild nature is matched with Si's calculated grace. She has her mother's looks, presumably, and her father's brains; disturbingly, a lot of his personality too. Not one to discriminate, Guy brought her up as he would a son; teaching her the art of war, not peace. 
						</p><p>
						Bright as polished steel, she picked up an education of sorts in between expulsions from the best schools. Where Guy is a cold fish, Sam has passions; immoderate, unreasonable, destructive passions. Like Si, she can handle anything, except boredom. 
						</p><p>
						Where Simon acts with considered precision, Sam finds joy in mindless violence. Exciting as he finds her, Simon begins to realise that she might be more trouble than she’s worth. When the mood takes her she will kill for pleasure and she will not tolerate any other women having any importance in the lives of the men within her orbit. When Simon is bored he may do something dangerous, when Sam is bored she will do something destructive.

						<p class="right">- Zara</p>
						<p>
						Ruthless, manipulative and utterly amoral, he is the scorpion who stung the frog. His nature undoes him. Presented with an opportunity for personal gain, or the destruction of others he will cheat, lie and kill without self restraint.
						</p><p>
						Although outwardly relaxed and apparently lazy, Guy has a driven quality. He sees others as objects for his use. He takes his reward in life from exercising his will over it and is in a subconscious war with the world of his class and peers which has rejected him. He comes from a military background, public school, Sandhurst, the Guards, but has a fatal flaw in his character which always leads him to defeat himself by doing something for a short term gain instead of a long term win.
						</p><p>
						Moving barely a step ahead of trouble from the Army to the darker peripheries of intelligence he finally fled the UK just ahead of the police with a good pile of his friends’ money. He washed up in the ancient smuggling port of Nador, Morocco where he set himself up as a small king in the teeth of those already there. He was building a reasonable trade in getting hash from the Rif mountains into Spain when he came across an opportunity to make some real money…
						</p><p>
						Never married, he has a daughter, the only person he’s ever had any respect for and perhaps, cared for: Sam.

						<p class="quote">“She has a way of looking at me from under her long lashes that is very sad. </p>
						<p class="right">- Si</p>
						<p>
						Slavery of one kind or another was written into Soumy’s destiny from generations back. As a child of a poor family and as a woman, she was never more than a commodity. Her father gave her to Guy in recompense for a consignment of hash that was lost. As the most beautiful of his women, he used her to keep house, and whatever else was asked of her, for his right-hand man. 
						</p><p>
						If Si treated her better than she expected, it was little to his credit. She served him as a slave and he accepted her service. He let her wear western clothes and didn’t beat her. Big deal. Where he is selfish and thoughtless she is kind and caring. Soumy is probably the wisest person Si will ever know. And one of the strongest. Sometimes he has the sense to see this and do what she tells him.

						</p><p>
						Zara is the latest in Guy’s carousel of amusements. Narcissistic, conceited and almost over the hill, with less significance to Guy than one of his cars; the only value she puts on herself is in her appearance. She is content as long as she’s got a drink in her hand and can most often be found passed out on a sun lounger by the pool. 
						</p><p>
						She is bitterly jealous of Sam, who aside from being young and beautiful, was a feature of Guy’s life before and will remain after Zara is discarded. Sam takes joy in tormenting Zara with her impermenancy: although Zara is historically an alpha female, she is nothing compared to Sam, who wins altercations before they even begin.

						<p class="quote"> “We just don’t want to lose you again, that’s all. I know you’ll always be restless. You’re like Avus in that way and it can’t be helped. We won’t try to make you into something you’re not.” </p>
						<p class="right">- Helen</p>
						<p>
						</p><p>
						Simon’s mother. Helen is beautiful and intelligent, capable of love and warmth but with poor capacity for self discipline she tends to a narcissistic self indulgence. In many ways kind and lovely, Helen has learned that the best way to approach life is to stay happy. If you don’t take it too seriously it can’t get you. 
						</p><p>
						In flight from the consequences and the pain inherent in the poor choices she has made, she tends to treat life, other people and herself as light, amusing things of little consequence. That said, when circumstances demand, she can be courageous, loyal and deeply caring. She and Simon share the trait that they are at their best when pushed and at their worst when subject to routine.
						</p><p>	
						Her parents, should they have been asked, would never have said that she was bred to ride to hounds, be decorative and provide heirs, but that is the truth of it. Tough and selfish, light and effervescent, charming beyond words, she brings chaos in her train and looks on bemused, not understanding what she’s done. Sometimes not even really understanding that others are not she.
						</p><p>	
						But that is not the whole of it. Life catches up with her in the desert and bursts the bubble. She discovers that she cares, and in her love for Ed, finds some of the maternal softness that had previously eluded her. In her son, when she sees him clearly, she finds a hero. Life of the heart starts late for her but good things are to come.
